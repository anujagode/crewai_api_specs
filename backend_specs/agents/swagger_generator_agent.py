    Based on the following extracted PRD text, generate a comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0.3 Swagger specification:

    --- EXTRACTED PRD TEXT ---
    {extracted_text}
    --- END OF EXTRACTED PRD TEXT ---

    Your task is to:
    1. Analyze the PRD thoroughly and extract API features.
    2. Identify API endpoints, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), request/response schemas, and error handling.
    3. Ensure the Swagger YAML follows best practices, including metadata, security schemes, and response examples.

    The Swagger YAML specification should:
    - Include metadata like API title, version, description, and servers.
    - Define all relevant API paths and methods with proper parameters and responses.
    - Include security mechanisms such as OAuth2, API Keys, or JWT authentication if mentioned.
    - Be fully validated according to OpenAPI 3.0.3 standards.
